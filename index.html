      <h2 class="big">Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We help teams to be prepared when they face a complex incident.</li>
        <li>This is done by simulation training with focus on how to do data driven investigation. The training is hands-on, so no big books and answers to memorize. These are real situations in a fail-safe environment.</li>
        <li>The skills learned here, can be used in the daily incident solving or in handling a security incident.</li>

      <h2 class="big">Incident response</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We can help investigate, assess and respond to an incident within your organzation:</li>
        <li>- If you have a complex incident</li>
        <li>- If you need help to find the root cause of a problem</li>
        <li>- If you need to know how an attack started, how they got in and if they still are active in your network</li>
         <li>This is done by using the same method and tools as in our training program.</li>
      </ul>
